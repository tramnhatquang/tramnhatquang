## About me
My name is Danny Tram, and I graduated from the University of Washington Bothell with a BS Degree majoring in Mathematics and minoring in Computer Science & Software Engineering (CSSE). As a Gen Z, I was born and raised seeing the miraculous and outstanding development of the Internet, or mobile, digital revolution. As a result, I was inspired and motivated by innovations like smartphones, AI, robotics, VR, autonomous vehicles, 3D printers, etc. Eventually, I believe that data can help people make critical decisions to solve complex, significant, and practical problems in reality, which leads me to choose Data Scientist/Data Analyst. Inside me, my endless curiosity and passion guide me to think and solve problems critically, clearly. As a detail-oriented man, I believe I will be a crucial teammate in any team I join along my endless and exciting journey ahead.
